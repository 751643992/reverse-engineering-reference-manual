__The Power Of Two__
* When reversing a target, you will likely run various basic static analysis, dynamic analysis, and/or automation tools to identify point of interests for further manual analysis. Once you identified all the point of interests, the majority of your time will be spent inside a disassembler and a debugger to try to figure out if any of those point of interests leads you closer to your goal (e.g. finding exploitable bugs). As a result, at least __know how to use a disassembler and a debugger well__.
